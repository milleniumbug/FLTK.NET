# FLTK.NET

C# bindings to the FLTK GUI library (strictly speaking, going through cfltk first)

The project is split up into FLTKNative which provides nothing more than raw bindings to cfltk, and FLTK.NET which is a high-level wrapper written in idiomatic C#

The project is a work in progress, the remaining APIs to implement are listed in [this file](https://github.com/milleniumbug/FLTK.NET/blob/main/FLTK.NET/include/remaining.h)

## License

TBD. I'll probably pick either MIT or whatever FLTK uses.
